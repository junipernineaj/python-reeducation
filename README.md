Reminding myself of all the Python

## 2a. Variables and simple data types

### title method

title() method capitalises the first letter of each word in a string

name.title() makes the title method act on the name variable

every method is followed by parenthesis

### lower method

lower() method lower cases all characters in a string

### upper method

upper() method capitalises all characters in a string

See name.py

### variables in strings

The f"{a}{b}" is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value

See full_name.py

### Tabs and Newlines

```
/t
/n
```
### Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines

Strip from the right, left and both:

```
print (favorite_language.rstrip())
print (favorite_language.lstrip())
print (favorite_language.strip())
```

### Apostrophes

Inside Double quotes or delimited with a backslash

## 2b. Numbers

### Operators 

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division as expected.

Exponents (to the power of - double star ** )

Also supports the order of operations

Also supports the order of operations - BODMAS - brackets, operators, division, multiplication, addition, subtractio

Spacing has no effect.

### Floats

Any number with a decimal point is a float

Normal maths works but sometimes you get random numbers of decimal places after the point

### Integers and Floats

When you divide any two integers you will always get a float.

Mixing integers and floats will also always give a float.

###Underscores in numbers

Python doesn't care - 100_000_000 is still 100000000

###Multiple Assignment

You can assign to x,y and z in one go with x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
