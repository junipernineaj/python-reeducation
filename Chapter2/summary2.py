# 2-8. Number Eight:
# Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8.
# Be sure to enclose your operations in print() calls to see the results.
# You should create four lines that look like this:

print(5+3)
print(10-2)
print((2+2)*2)
print((1+3)*2)
print((10+5+1)/2)

# Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

# 2-9. Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number.
# Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.
